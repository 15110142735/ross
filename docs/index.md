ROSS is a library written in Python for rotordynamic analysis. The source code is
available at [github](https://github.com/ross-rotordynamics/ross).

For a fast introduction to the library you can check out the :doc:`tutorials <tutorials>`
and {doc}`examples <examples>`. These are also available on [binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ross-rotordynamics/ross/0.4?filepath=%2Fdocs%2Fexamples).

ROSS has a core library in which you can create elements (shaft, disks, bearings etc.) and assemble these elements in a rotor object where you can run analysis.

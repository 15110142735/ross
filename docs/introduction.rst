What you need to do to start using ross 
=======================================

.. _introduction:

Programming language: Python
----------------------------

Ross - rotordynamic open-source software is an Python application for rotordynamic
analysis. If you don't have Python installed in your machine, the first thing you should do is install it.

Since ross requires a number of packages to be installed besides
Python, such as numpy, we recommend installing Anaconda 
`Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_ which is a distribution of Python for scientific computing
that aims to simplify package management and deployment. It contains Python and a large number
of packages that are commonly used.
Alternativaly, you may refer to the `Python website
<http://www.python.org/>`_.
Ross's code was tested in Python 3.6 and higher, so make sure you
get a similar version.
Although you don't need to know Python to run ross,
you need to be able to follow the instructions in :ref:`tutorial`, some coding included.

Version-control system: Git
---------------------------

Git is a version-control system (VCS) for tracking changes in code during software development.
In order to download the ross source code and contribute to its development,
you need Git installed in your machine. Refer to the `Git website
<https://git-scm.com/>`_ and follow the instructions to download and install it.
Once you have Git installed, you will be able to follow the instructions in :ref:`git-configuration`,
which explains how to download and contribute to ross.

Repository hosting service: Github
----------------------------------

Source code is hosted in `Github
<https://github.com/>`_, a web-based hosting service for version control using Git.
You don't need a Github account to download and use ross, but you will need one in case you
want to contribute to its development. Refer to :ref:`git-configuration` if you want to
know how to contribute to ross.

Integrated development environment: PyCharm
-------------------------------------------

The ross development team adopted PyCharm as integrated development environment (IDE).
You don't need PyCharm to run or contribute to ross, as you can choose your preferred IDE or
even no IDE at all. But in case you want to use PyCharm, go to the `PyCharm website
<https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`_ to download and install it.

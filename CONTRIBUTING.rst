Feedback and Contribution
-------------------------
We welcome any contribution via `ross's issue tracker<https://github.com/ross-rotordynamics/ross/issues>`_.
These include bug reports, problems on the documentation, feedback, enhancement proposals etc.
The issue tracker can also be used for questions and further information, since the project does not use a mailing list.

Version-control system: Git
---------------------------

Git is a version-control system (VCS) for tracking changes in code during software development.
In order to download the ross source code and contribute to its development,
you need Git installed in your machine. Refer to the `Git website
<https://git-scm.com/>`_ and follow the instructions to download and install it.
Once you have Git installed, you will be able to follow the instructions in :ref:`git-configuration`,
which explains how to download and contribute to ross.

Repository hosting service: Github
----------------------------------

Source code is hosted in `Github
<https://github.com/>`_, a web-based hosting service for version control using Git.
You don't need a Github account to download and use ross, but you will need one in case you
want to contribute to its development. Refer to :ref:`git-configuration` if you want to
know how to contribute to ross.

Code style: Black
-----------------
Code formatting is done with `Black<https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_, which is the *"uncompromising Python
code formatter"*. You can configure your development environment to use Black before a commit. More information on how
to set this is given at `Black's documentation<https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/editor_integration.html>`_.

Integrated development environment: PyCharm
-------------------------------------------

The ross development team adopted PyCharm as integrated development environment (IDE).
You don't need PyCharm to run or contribute to ross, as you can choose your preferred IDE or
even no IDE at all. But in case you want to use PyCharm, go to the `PyCharm website
<https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`_ to download and install it.
